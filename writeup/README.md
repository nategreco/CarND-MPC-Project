# **Model Predictive Control (MPC) Project**

### Vehicle control using the MPC model

---

**Model Predictive Control (MPC) Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Complete starter code to succesfully drive vehicle in simulator with MPC model


---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.

My project includes the following files:
* [main.cpp](../src/main.cpp) main program that runs the IO server (given from starter code), fits the polynomial trajectory, and handles the actuator delays
* [MPC.cpp](../src/MPC.cpp) implements the Model Preditive Control class
* [MPC.h](../src/MPC.h) header file for [MPC.cpp](../src/MPC.cpp)
* [TrackRecording.mp4](./TrackRecording.mp4) video of a single lap around the course in the simulator

### Discussion

#### 1. Implementation

ToDo
* Model description
* Timestep length and duration tuning
* Polynomial fitting and preprocessing implementation
* Model latency consideration

#### 2. Results

ToDo

Results:

[TrackRecording.mp4](./TrackRecording.mp4)
